      <h1>Tax cuts to scale</h1>

      <p>
        Let's talk about scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last year, the BoM announced an unfortunate rebrand that was universally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/19/bom-rebranding-logo-cost-220k-australia-weather-bureau-of-meteorology-name-change-tanya-plibersek">condemned</a> as <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/220k-bureau-of-meteorology-rebranding-ridiculous-says-plibersek-20221019-p5br65.html">wasteful</a> <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-19/bureau-meteorology-rebrand-cost-200-thousand/101552620">spending</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the total cost to the taxpayer came in at a meagre $220 thousand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compare that to the $5 billion we spent <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-01/cancelled-french-submarine-program-cost-billions/100959082">not buying</a> nuclear submarines from France, and, well, you can’t really.
      </p>

      <p>
        You could rebrand the BoM once a day for 68 years for that much money, and yet the two stories got similar amounts of coverage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Human brains aren't well suited to dealing with large sums of cash, 
        which becomes a problem when we want to have a conversation about how and where we spend Australia’s money.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, with the stage 3 tax cuts due to kick in soon, we thought we’d give you a hand putting their price tag into perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        The budget office estimates that they will open up a $243 billion hole in the national budget over the next ten years.
