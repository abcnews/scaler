      When Jim Chalmers made his budget speech to parliament in October, he promised the spending was going to be “responsible, not reckless.”
      </p>
      <p>

        Then he threw out a bunch of figures, most of which were in the billions. 
        <!-- Child care, cost-of-living relief, fee-free TAFE. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        We’re used to working with budgets in the hundreds and thousands of dollars – for the lucky among us, we'll buy a house for more than a million from time to time.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when prices get much bigger than that, we lose all sense of scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        How are we to judge whether spending $7.5 billion on cost of living relief is "responsible" or "reckless"?
      </p>

      <!-- Last year, the BoM announced an unfortunate rebrand that was universally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/19/bom-rebranding-logo-cost-220k-australia-weather-bureau-of-meteorology-name-change-tanya-plibersek">condemned</a> as <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/220k-bureau-of-meteorology-rebranding-ridiculous-says-plibersek-20221019-p5br65.html">wasteful</a> <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-19/bureau-meteorology-rebrand-cost-200-thousand/101552620">spending</a>. -->

      <p>
      <!-- It cost a meagre $220 thousand. -->
      </p>
      <p>
      <!-- Compare that to the $5 billion we spent <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-01/cancelled-french-submarine-program-cost-billions/100959082">not buying</a> nuclear submarines from France, and, well, you can’t really. You could rebrand the BoM once a day for 68 years for that. -->

      <p>
        One of the most controvserial items on the government's balance sheet – the coming stage 3 tax cuts – are estimated to cost $243 billion over the next ten years.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's more than double the amount earmarked for transport infrastructure over the same time period.
      </p>

      <p>
        It would take the average Australian over two million years to earn that much at their day job. Or, if we were in a James Bond movie, it’d fill about <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriefcaseFullOfMoney">one thousand briefcases stacked with $100 bills</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those comparisons really aren't helping, so let's have a real go at putting $243 billion into perspective.
